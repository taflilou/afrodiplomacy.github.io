# afrodiplomacy

## Content
afrodiplomacy üåç is a blog focused on diplomacy, `the African way`. For far too long, African countries have not been masters of their destinies. It was mainly due to the fact that Africans traditions to pass knowledge through generations have been destroyed, by many ways. As technology has become by far the major way to transmit knowledge üìö nowadays, I'm creating this blog for those who interested to learn more on how geopolitics affect their daily lives and how mastering them will enable them to become wealthier. 

## Languages
Language can be a huge barrier to pass knowledge throughout generations, between people originated from different ethnicities, countries, backgrounds. In this blog, I intend to use the languages that I know best. I'm a mother tongue French speaker and I fluently speak English and Italian.
I also plan to publish some contents using data analysis tools, but in any case, I will use basic terms in order to vulgarise my thoughts to many people as possible.
