<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ecause education is key to raise a new generation of African leaders to build wealth, prosperity and peace in their countries</p>

As I was raised into a grown-up man, I feel like I've always missed a "paternal figure" in my life. I belive thousands if not millions of Africans can relate to that experience. Sad thing is, you can easily waste some years of your life by not having the good advice or mentor in the moment of your life you need it. Been there, lived that. This blog post is based on my own experience and relates what an African male should do in his life to try to be more successful. Again, I believe success is a very relative concept. One can have million of dollars in his bank account and feel he's not successed in life, and someone else only a few bucks and dozens of children and feels like he's the king of universe. Again, this list is only based on my own criterias; but I'm sure many of you can relate to it !
