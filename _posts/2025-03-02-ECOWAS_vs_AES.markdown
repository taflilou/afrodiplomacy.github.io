<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here is definitely a leadership competition in West Africa right now. As millions of people are struggling to survive, a new organization is born from the Sahel region. Will AES be able to bring prospertity and stability to the people of West Africa ?</a></p>

After decades of war against terrorists and separatifs, "Coup d'Etat" have put military officers and generals as head of states of the countries of Mali, Burkina-Faso and Niger. Even though the people oof those countries are still struggling to defeat terrorism within their borders, it is very clear that those military regims have ben backed by the people of those countries. Never in the last 20 years have we seen people demonstrations and protests to quick military presence of foreign countries like the ones we've seen in Niamey in ?????.

There is a wind of "dégagisme" that is clearly visible and coming from the Sahel towards the south like "l'Harmattan". To such a point that Senegal elected a young populist vice/president and even Ivory Coast had to take back the biggest foreign base in the region (namely 43ème BIMA) and renamed it after an Ivoirian General.
Now, let's stick to the people of West Africa aspirations. With an estimated population of around 500 millions, West African populations desperately need basic resources; water, energy, health, and security. On top of that, certainly free trade and free movement of persons and goods. The average age of those populations is like 15/16 years old. Thousands or millions of young people get to the job market every year and are forced to take either low payed jobs like taxi/motor driver, nails technician, in order to put food on the table by the end of the day, for themselves and their families.

When they had enough of this struggle, many are tempted to migrate to Europe or the Americas to the peril of their lives. This desperation has been going on for decades. They've had enough of the countless fake elections, unkept politican promises, and are desperetaly needing for change, whatever might it be. It is therefore no surprising that they've gathered by thousands in front of the French embassy in Niamey to ask for the expell of the ambassador, whom attitude was full of condescendance, not remembering that "he is the guest, not the host".
In the West, people seem to not understand, that the West Africans people are tired of neing exploited and are fully aware they are the "vache laitière" of so many countries and people around the Globe. They are fully aware that their uranium empower some G7 countries, and that DRC uranium was used for WW3 atomic bombs, and so on, and so forth... The "real size of Africa" pretty much relates in my humble opinion how countries are benefitting from Africa at its expense.
