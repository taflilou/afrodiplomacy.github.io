<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he United Nations projects that by 2050, Africa's population will reach close to 2.5 billion. Such a figure would mean that more than 25 percent of the world's population will be African. <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/Fandd/Article/2023/September/Picture-this-0923.ashx">Source</a></p>

As the US policy towards Africa is guided by the super head of only one person, namely: Donald J. Trump, let's try to dig in his mind and understand what will be the US administration policy towards Africa.

"They are eating the dogs, they are eating the cats !"
Sounds pretty normal to me, if one has nothing to eat, doesn't have the right to work and earn money for a living and feed himself and his family.
USA and the Western world are probably the exception ! In ...countries of out ...., people can eat dogs and cats. Even the Chinese !!!!
