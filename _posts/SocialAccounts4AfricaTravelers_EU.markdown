<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hatever age you are, whatever your social class or profession, sometimes you must miss the place you were born or the place you relate to. No matter your race, sex, profession or social class. When you're happy and mental health is improving, you're feeling better and improve your interactions with locals. This post is about helping people with African descent find those places or events where they can also feel home.</p>

As the population of people from African descent is growing in Europe (actually everywhere in the world), the need to find places or events when one can relate to is growing. Awareness around mental health and being part of a society is also raising. Same as African restaurants, events and so forth, which can help having happier and therefore better citizens for their communities and to the country as a whole. This post is about referencing those places/events through social media accounts. Transportation is pretty cheap in Europe, so wherever you are, you have no excuse to not feeling better (for yourself).
