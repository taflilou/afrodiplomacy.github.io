description: "Why not applying Trump's 101 economy lessons to Africa ?"

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hile POTUS (Mr. Donald Trump) is showcasing his genuine economy skills to the entire world, why souldn't African countries and stakeholders learn from his principles ?</p>

USA President elected aka POTUS is actually blowing hot and cold to the entire global economy and financial markets. Yet, European "friends"so  and others from the Western World are complaining about those tarrifs. But the economy principles behind Trump's policy are not wrong after all. He just applies reciprocity tarrifs to countries having an inequal commercial balance with the United States of America. Is that wrongdoing ? I don't think so ...

In my humble opinion, African countries should get inspired by Trump's method to understand at which point their commmercial balance is, and plan to diversify their partners to have as much as possible equal commercial balance with the countries they trade with. Is India or Pakistan selling a lot of chemical countries to our country and thus creating a huge defficitary balance with our country ? Yes ? Then, we must be able to sell the same amount of goods to that same country, and by this process create jobs and business opportunities in our country. If the foreign country does not accept, then maybe it is time to find another partner/supplier. I'm sure plenty other countries could replace and will be more than happy to trade with us, and hopefully, at lower prices.

I've tried to find data relative to African countries trade balance and the best one I oculd find online is the [IMF trade balance](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/BT_GDP@AFRREO/GAB/CEMAC/BEN).
Let's wiki the basics:
- [Trade balance (balance of trade)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade): is the difference between the monetary value of a nation's exports and imports of goods over a certain time period. ... If a country exports a greater value than it imports, it has a trade surplus or positive trade balance, and conversely, if a country imports a greater value than it exports, it has a trade deficit or negative trade balance.

Let's then have a closer look at IMF trade balance picture below:

Yes, I totally admit that the legend colors are not the best. But the darker towards red, the higher trade balance is; meaning the country exports more than it imports. If the color is more towards green (thus negative), it means the country imports more than it exports.

From that perspective, we can clearly see that countries like RdC, Angola, Gabon, Zambia, Congo, Chad export a lot compared to their GDP while countries like Ethiopia, Namibia, Liberia, Malawi, Lesotho, Madagastar, Togo import a lot, compared to their GDP.  

To build a wealthy and prosperous nation, a country needs to export a lot of high costs products and import the minimum it needs to build those products. That's how China became in a few decades the second enconomy in the world... By importing cheap raw meterials from Africa and South East Asia, and building top pricey products like IPhones and nowadays even Tesla and exporting them around the world, not to mention every cheap (and ofren low-quality) products that they've build to export all over the world. The economic policy especially towards poorest countries is very smart. They want us to buy as many products as possible from them and let's be honest, the best way to achieve that is to sell sometimes the same product over and over again, whenever you need it. I remember when I was a teenager in West Africa, that I was obliged to regularly buy air chamber (not sure if is called lke that in English, let's say new tires then) for my motorcycle, made from China of course, and cheap ones; because I couldn't afford to buy pricey legit EU or Japanese made ones. In Europe, I recently bought new tires for my car after many many years of good service. And I can definitely notice the price/value ratio. But if I was living in a poor country, I would probably earn very less and couldn't afford to buy "original" tires for my car.

So, to stakeholders and ministers, please take in mind the long term benefice when you are signing contrats with any stakeholders. And remember: your country will be a prosperous nation when you will export the maximum and pricey products and import the less products possible.

Best of luck !
