<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">2025</span> will be another crucial election year in Africa. The destiny of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECOWAS">CEDEAO/ECOWAS</a> is very much linked to the Ivorian presidential election</p>

2025 will be a crucial year in Africa, especially in West Africa.
Here are the elections planned this year:

- 🇰🇲 Comoros (parliamentary): 12 January
- 🇹🇬 Togo: 15 February (parliamentary) & (presidential ?)
- 🇬🇦 Gabon: 12 April
- 🇧🇮 Burundi (presidential): 5 June 2025
- 🇲🇼 Malawi: 16 September
- 🇸🇨 Seychelles: 27 September
- 🇹🇿 Tanzania: 28 October
- 🇨🇲 Cameroon: (presidential + parliamentary) 5 October
- 🇨🇮 Ivory Coast: (presidential) October
- 🇬🇼 Guinea-Bissau: (presidential) 30 November
- 🇨🇫 Central African Republic: December
- 🇪🇬 Egypt (parliamentary): No date so far

As I'm originally from West Africa, I feel very concerned about the Ivorian presidential election. 
It seems very unclear so far who will definitely be able to run for those elections, and especially who won't.
From what I can tell here are the major players :
- Alassane Dramane Ouattara (current president)
- Laurent Gbagbo
- Blé Goudé
- Tidiane Thiam
- Guillaume Soro
- Jean-Louis Billon
- Simone Gbagbo

There is a lot to know to understand the stake of the 2025 Ivoirian presidential elections. Let me try to give you some good pointers.

First of all, there has been a ['civil war'](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crise_politico-militaire_en_C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire) in Ivory Coast in 2002, opposing two of the potential candidates (Ouattara VS Gbagbo). There has been a "foreign" military intervention and Ouattara has become president. He has been running the country since then and won the next elections since that political crisis (2010, 2015, 2020), even though the Constitution wouldn't allow him to run for more than 2 terms. Many think he will still try to run in 2025. After the Ivorian crisis, Gbagbo has been sent to IPC in The Hague, but was finally freed in 2021. Another major aspect of this presidency is the regional fight between AES bloc (Mali, Burkina-Faso and Niger) and the ECOWAS regional organization.

Let's see what 2025 bring to the West African people ...
