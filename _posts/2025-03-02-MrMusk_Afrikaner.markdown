<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Mr</span> Musk is someone that you've heard of, whether you like him or not. His businesses are very successful, making him the richest man on earth. But one thing most people ignore about him is that he is born in Apartheid South Africa and is originally South African, thus his vision of the world!</p>

Mr Elon Musk is born in Apartheid South Africa. For those who don't know, what is Apartheid South Africa ?
A ountry located in the southern part of Africa in which thousands if not millions of Europeans have emigrated, exterminate some local populations, took property of their lands, and put them under the rule of segregation in their own country for decades. These Europeans were mostly coming from the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, France, Poland, ...
Mr Musk's father has also "acquired" a diamond mine and became rich, so rich to put his kids in private white-only South African schools at that time. Elon graduated and emigrated first to Canada where he acquired citizenship and then to the USA when he also acquired American citizenship.

I feel like Elon n his latests remarks and attitude, really show that his world vision is derivated from Apartheid, where the rich, white people bring civilization to the world and have power against the poors and are legitimate to colonize every place they desire (even Mars) in order to keep their power and dominance.
