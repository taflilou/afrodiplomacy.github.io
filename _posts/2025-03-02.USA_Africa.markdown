<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he United Nations projects that by 2050, Africa's population will reach close to 2.5 billion. Such a figure would mean that more than 25 percent of the world's population will be African. <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/Fandd/Article/2023/September/Picture-this-0923.ashx">Source</a></p>

I've never traveled to the United States
But USA has been somehow present in all my life
From childhood, cinema, music, culture, clothes we wear
Even in Europe, USA influence has been very present

As for the relationship with Africa, Obama seemed a promise
But Africa got very few things there, even nothing at all

But there are of course good aspects of it
Ghana year of return is actually a good one
I see much more African American people coming to Africa, for Detty December for example
Mostly African immigrants who have settled for one, two, three generations already in the US
There is the same thing in Europe, but sadly low income and very expensive flight tickets to Africa dont help the movement to grow further

Benin, also announced granting citizenship to all people from African descent over the globe

Those initiaves in my view give much more credit and are in the way of getting USA people and African people closer. Yes I know, for now it's mainly US people from African descent.
Let's not forget that USA has been also very active in the religious and humanitarian fields.
We used to see thousand of USAID and other humanitarian organizations coming to Africa, heping build dwells and schools for the local people. Well, some of my fellow Africans friends seem to doubt about the real intentions behind those acts of generosity. Maybe it's also a way to explore potential oil fields, or other mineral resources. Who knows ?

For sure, African culture has been very critized in the past, and nowadays, since we see actions of POTUS willing to annex and tax everyone, a lot of people throughout the world will become nationalist and I think it iwll for sure benefit Africa in some ways. We will also understand that we need to build on our own resources, whether there are local or living in the diasporas.

African music is booming also in the US and across the globe. It is funny how a  lot of African American people can relate to the music made in Africa, especially Afrobeats. I guess it will be one of the major source of connection between the USA and Africa, not to mention of course that many of the top players in the NBA league are originated from Africa.

Also check the Lobito corridor
WW2 bombs uranium was originated from Africa
USA has many military bases in Africa
USA Africa military command AFRICOM is in Germany ? What possible changes under the Trump administration ?
