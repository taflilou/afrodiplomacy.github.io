<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>frica will be home to a growing population. Millions of people will travel more and more for business or leisure, from the diaspora or from the continent itself. To travel wisely, one must know/own certain things.</a></p>

In this blog post, I try to describe what one would need to enhance his/her travel life experience to Africa in 2025.

1. eSIM: mobile data is the #1 thing to find your way and stay in touch with relatives and settle your journey. You can use [esimdb](https://esimdb.com/) to find the suitable one for you.
2. Money: In general, it's preferable to have higher bank notes when you travel to Africa. For some unknown reasons, rates are not the same whether you have $100/100€+ or $5/5€ ones. The higher bank notes you have, the higher the rates. Make sure you exchange your bank notes before you travel to Africa.
3. Car: travelig by car can be a very big hassle in Africa, especially for border crossing. While 'carnet de passage' can ease the journey, it may cost you more money but is definitely an amazing way to travel in Africa.
4. International Driver License: Some countries allow you to drive with your national driver country. Some countries don't. Driving in Africa can be challenging. But it's always good to have the right to drive in case you find yourself in a situation where you have to. It's better to have your international driver license that you can order in your home country. Plan in advance because it can take months to be delivered based on your country.
5. Money change: Africa is home to many currencies. Whether it is CFA, Naira, Cedi, Shilling, Dirham or another currency, you may always find currency traders at the airports and border crossings, but they do not always offer the best rates. Having a Revolut card or XXX can definitely facilitate your journey money-wise.
6. Maps: Definitely Google Maps or Waze and other geoloc apps are your friends.
7. Park4Night: in case you travel by car, available to do some camping/bivouac, this app hosted on PlayStore and iStore can help you find nice and safe spots to spend the night.
8. Google Translate: If you do not speak the local language, it may be cumbersome to interact with locals. Google Translate will be your best friend then who speaks dozen of languages and help you interact with the local population.
9. Bolt/Uber/Yango: in order to get from point A to point B, whenever you need, with a safe and registered driver (better to use the cash option)
10. Yango/Ubereats: for food deliveries whenever you need
11. Google Maps: to find your way around and plan your trip; you can even download the city offline to spare your data SIM plan when you will be in Africa  
12. UnityLink: in order to send money from Europe/US to your mobile money account in Africa
