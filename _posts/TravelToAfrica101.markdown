<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">A</span>frica will be home to a growing population. Millions of people will travel more and more for business or leisure, from the diaspora or from the continent itself. To travel wisely, one must know/own certain things.</a></p>

In this blog post, I try to describe what one would need to enhance his/her travel life experience to Africa in 2025.

1. eSIM: mobile data is the #1 thing to find your way and stay in touch with relatives and settle your journey. You can use: XXXXXXX
2. Car: travelig by car can be a very big hassle in Africa, especially for border crossing. While 'carnet de passage' can ease the journey, it may cost you more money but is definitely an amazing way to travel in Africa.
3. Money change: Africa is home to many currencies. Whether it is CFA, Naira, Cedi, Shilling, Dirham or another currency, you may always find currency traders at the airports and border crossings, but they do not always offer the best rates. Having a Revolut card or XXX can definitely facilitate your journey money-wise.
4. Maps: Definitely Google Maps or Waze and other geoloc apps are your friends.
5. Park4Night: in case you travel by car, available to do some camping/bivouac, this app hosted on PlayStore and iStore can help you find nice and safe spots to spend the night.
6. Google Translate: If you do not speak the local language, it may be cumbersome to interact with locals. Google Translate will be your best friend then who speaks dozen of languages and help you interact with the local population.
7. Bolt/Uber: in order to get from point A to point B, whenever you need, with a safe and registered driver (better to use the cash option)
8. Yango/Ubereats: for food deliveries whenever you need
9. Google Maps: to find your way around and plan your trip; you can even download the city offline to spare your data SIM plan when you will be in Africa  
10. UnityLink: in order to send money from Europe/US to your mobile money account in Africa
