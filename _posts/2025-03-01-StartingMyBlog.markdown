<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he United Nations projects that by 2050, Africa's population will reach close to 2.5 billion. Such a figure would mean that more than 25 percent of the world's population will be African. <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/Fandd/Article/2023/September/Picture-this-0923.ashx">Source</a></p>


In high school, I was taught that the Americas were "discovered" by "Christopher Columbus" ...
During casual discussions, I found out that none of my colleagues (in Europe) knew that 99% of the current borders of the African continent were actually made in ... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Conference">Berlin</a>.

"L'effet papillon" is a metaphore that I really like in the sense that it explains how much we are interconnected: « Un battement d'ailes de papillon au Brésil peut-il déclencher une tornade au Texas ? »

Everyone seems curiously so surprised by the actions of POTUS but me, I'm not surprised at all. In fact, as I was born in Africa and lived in many coutries across the continent, I am used to see foreign countries interfer in local politics and elections in Africa. 99% of the time, it results in protests, deaths, anger, fear, traumas for entire generations. The only difference nowadays is to see this applying to 'Western countries' as well.
In Africa, from the food we eat to the language we speak, shows we see on TV, lessons we are taught in schools, cars we get to see or drive, clothes we wear, almost everything in our lives is influenced if not dictated by countries external/aliens to the African continent. It's not victimism, it's just FACTS.

African will see a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/27/megalopolis-how-coastal-west-africa-will-shape-the-coming-century">massive population boom</a> like no continent ever saw since the beginning of humanity, especially West Africa where I'm originally from. At some point in my career, I wanted to give my contribution and worked for one of the main agencies of the UN. 'Disappointment' is an under-statement of what I saw there. It's scary to see that even at their level, there are still only caring and focused on their bonuses and priviledges, sponsoring themselves between old white people from the Western emisphere and only "employing" ('exploiting' is a better word) people from the so-called 'developing countries' only when necessary.
Nobody seems to realize the tsunami which is awaiting us is nobody cares ... and takes ACTION.
I'm in my mid-thirties, so I'm already considered in the 10% of the oldest slice of the African population. Being educated, well-travelled already makes me part of the so-called "elite" even though I don't consider myself to be a part of.
A mismanagement of the African population boom will create CHAOS, not only for Africa but for the entire world.

After years of mulling over ideas, I finally decided to create this blog and take action. I am convinced that Africa's role in the World will become more and more visible (in good or bad way). We all need to invest in changing the geopolical strategies involved in the African continent by making citizens, aware of their actions and enabling them for change for a more prosperous world for everyone. It is therefore essential for the African continent to have its own geopolitical vision.

As the world order is currently in taters, and it seems like nobody knows what the future will be made of. I am very surprised that even 'superpowers' leaders don't know what they are doing and have very partial understanding of our world.
You are certainly reading this blog from a phone screen, or a tablet so be aware that you already hold a little bit of Africa in your hands... Question: has the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bf4dafef-a61f-442b-9c4d-d87abdea86e3?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> mining or telco industry</a> paid the right contribution to the African miners who made possible this transformation of metals or rare earths to this phone or tablet screen ? As people in your country seem so vocal about the Ouighour 'slavery' in China, are they also about the disaster in Democratic Republic of Congo ?

A better understanding of geopolitics dynamics across the world with a focus on Africa, in my opinion, will for sure help us all live in a better world. This blog will share history facts, maps, posts regarding situations which have a great impact of African and it's citizens lives.
