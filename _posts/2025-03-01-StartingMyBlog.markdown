<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he United Nations projects that by 2050, Africa's population will reach close to 2.5 billion. Such a figure would mean that more than 25 percent of the world's population will be African. <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/Fandd/Article/2023/September/Picture-this-0923.ashx">Source</a> </p>


After years of mulling over ideas, I finally decided to create this blog and finally take action.
I am convinced that Africa's role in the World will become more and more visible and it is therefore essential for the Africa continent to have its own geopolitical vision.
Despite the divergences and conflicts that may oppose certain states, ethnic groups or peoples of the African continent, the fact remains that Africa will be (if we assume that this is not already the case) certainly a geopolitical GIANT on a World scale and that no one will be able to do without Africa.
First of all, if you are reading this blog from a phone screen, or a tablet, know that you already hold a little bit of Africa in your hands... It is therefore essential for Africa and particularly for African decision-makers and citizens to better understand the world and take greater advantage of it for their own well-being.
And above all, get rid of toxic friendships and relationships for a more harmonious development.
So I say welcome to this blog!
