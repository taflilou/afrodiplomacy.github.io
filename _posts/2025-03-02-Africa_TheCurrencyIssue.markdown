<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">C</span>FA franc is dommed to be replaced. By which currency ? When ? Why the process is tking so long ?</p>

Francs CFA, is the currency I've been using from my teenage age until I became a young adult. I've been living in West and Central Africa. The strongets memory I can recall with this currency is sometimes between the year 2000 when my dad was totally depressed because the French government, at that time, decided to divide its value by half. Everything was going to be more expensive and in all countries using this currency, that was a big trauma.
How come a government of a foreign country should be able to decide other's countries currency value ? How come a minister who never set on Africa and know its people should decide the value of the currency they use ?
There's definitely something wrong behind the scenes but let's just say I'm pretty convince that CFA is living its last years ...
