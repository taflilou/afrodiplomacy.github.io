Hi, Bonjour, Buongiorno, Hallo, Grüß Gott, Jambo, 你好, सुप्रभात, Hola,

I created this blog to talk about African related topics and discuss how Africa and its people can help the "World" be a better place for "everyone". As of today (Feb. 19th 2025), the world is becoming totally CRAZY. For decades, I had a lot of ideas but always postponed to implement them. afrodiplomacy is one of them. I'm totally convince that my continent, Africa has what it takes to help the world be a better place for everyone in the world.

about me:
I was born in Africa and lived most of my life in Europe. I worked as an engineer for different kind of companies (multinationals, international organizations, SMEs) and have met different people all across the world, with very diverse backgrounds.
