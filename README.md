# afrodiplomacy

## Content
afrodiplomacy 🌍 is a blog focused on diplomacy, `the African way`. For far too long, African countries have not been masters of their destiny. It was mainly due to the fact that Africans traditions to pass knowledge through generations have been destroyed, by many ways. As technology has become by far the major way to transmit knowledge 📚, I'm creating this blog for those who interested to learn more.  

## Languages
Language can be a huge barrier to pass knowledge through generations. In this blog, I intend to use the languages that I know the best. I'm a mother tongue French speaker and I fluently speak English and Italian.
I also plan to publish some contents using data analysis tools, but in any case, will use basics to vulgarise what I want to share to many people as possible.
